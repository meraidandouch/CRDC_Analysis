# CRDC_Analysis
This analysis attempts to explain the 2017-2018 CRDC dataset by examining school-related arrests and its association with student demographics. By creating a dashboard in Tableau, I aim to highlight racial disparities of minority groups such as American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, Black, Hispanic, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander individuals. Data was collected from the CRDC, a project established from the Department of Education to gather data pertaining to civil rights issues in our nation's public schools. Below you will find a snapshot of what the interative dashboard looks like. However, I was unable to share this dashboard due to access limitations imposed by a paywall. Future studies should work to examine the underlying factors that might perpetuate these circumstances such as funding, salaries and support.
